# Trinity Documentation Style Guide

When creating or updating documentation for Trinity/WorkSphere, follow these principles:

## Target Audience

Write for someone who needs to understand **how the system works** and **how components connect** — NOT a developer reference.

**Target readers:**
- Technical product managers
- Solutions architects evaluating the platform
- New team leads getting up to speed
- Anyone who wants to understand the platform without reading code

## What TO Include

- **Plain-English explanations** of flows and connections
- **"What happens when..."** narratives (e.g., "When a user asks a question...")
- **Conceptual diagrams** using ASCII art or Mermaid
- **Why things work the way they do**
- **How components connect** to each other
- **Key terminology** explained in accessible terms
- **Tables for quick reference** of concepts (not APIs)

## What NOT to Include

- Function names, method signatures, or code snippets
- API endpoint details with request/response schemas
- Database field names and column schemas
- Configuration variables and environment settings
- Import statements or file paths in code
- Lists of component names or hooks

## Writing Style

- Use conversational, accessible language
- Explain concepts before using jargon
- Use diagrams to show flows (ASCII diagrams work well)
- Break complex processes into numbered steps
- Use quotes to show example user questions
- Write headings as questions or actions ("How Login Works" not "Login Implementation")

## When New Documents Are Brought In

1. **Review the source documents** to understand the content
2. **Identify the key concepts** and how they connect
3. **Rewrite in the Trinity docs style** — focus on flows and connections
4. **Remove developer-level details** (function names, schemas, code)
5. **Add to the sidebar** in the appropriate category
6. **Cross-link** to related documentation sections
7. **Rebuild and verify** no broken links

## Document Structure

Each doc should have:
1. **Title and description** in frontmatter
2. **Overview paragraph** explaining what this section covers
3. **Conceptual explanation** with diagrams where helpful
4. **"Related Documentation"** table at the end linking to other sections

## Example Transformation

**Before (developer-level):**
```
The databaseService provides CRUD operations:
- getAllChatHistory()
- getChatHistoryByUser(userId)
- saveChatSession(session)
```

**After (conceptual):**
```
The Chat Service manages conversation records:
- Saves each conversation so users can return later
- Retrieves past conversations by user
- Allows users to delete old conversations
```
