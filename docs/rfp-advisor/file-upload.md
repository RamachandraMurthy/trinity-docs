# File Upload & Processing

RFP Advisor accepts common document formats and automatically processes them for AI analysis. This page explains what happens when you upload a file.

---

## Supported File Types

| Format | Extensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PDF** | `.pdf` | Primary format — text extracted directly |
| **Word** | `.docx` | Converted to PDF, then processed |
| **PowerPoint** | `.pptx` | Converted to PDF, then processed |

Files can be up to 10 MB each. Legacy formats (`.doc`, `.ppt`) are not supported — convert them to modern formats before uploading.

## What Happens When You Upload

When a document is uploaded, it goes through several processing stages:

```
Upload Document
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 1: Storage                                           │
│                                                             │
│  The original file is saved to Azure Blob Storage.          │
│  A record is created in the database with status "uploaded" │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 2: Conversion (if needed)                            │
│                                                             │
│  Word and PowerPoint files are converted to PDF.            │
│  This preserves tables, images, and formatting.             │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 3: Text Extraction                                   │
│                                                             │
│  Text content is extracted from the PDF.                    │
│  This becomes the searchable content.                       │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 4: AI Summary                                        │
│                                                             │
│  An AI generates a 3-5 paragraph summary capturing:         │
│  • Main topic and purpose                                   │
│  • Key requirements or terms                                │
│  • Important deadlines or conditions                        │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 5: Indexing                                          │
│                                                             │
│  The content is indexed for search:                         │
│  • Text is added to the search index                        │
│  • Vector embeddings enable semantic search                 │
│  • Status changes to "analyzed"                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All of this happens in the background — users can continue working while files process.

## File Status

Each file has a status that shows its processing state:

| Status | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Uploaded** | File received and stored, processing starting |
| **Processing** | Text extraction and indexing in progress |
| **Analyzed** | Complete — ready for search and agent analysis |
| **Error** | Something went wrong (see error message for details) |

The interface shows a progress indicator during processing. Large documents may take a minute or two to fully process.

---

## File Types for Classification

When uploading, users can classify documents:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **RFP Document** | The original request for proposal |
| **Proposal Response** | Your team's response drafts |
| **Other** | Supporting materials, references, etc. |

This classification helps organize files within a project and helps agents understand the context of each document.

---

## How Documents Are Stored

Files are organized in Azure Blob Storage by project:

```
Project Folder
├── Original RFP.pdf
├── Our Response v1.docx
├── Technical Requirements.pdf
└── Supporting Materials/
    └── Case Studies.pdf
```

Reports generated by WorkSphere Agents are stored separately and linked to the agent run record.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **File too large** | Exceeds 10 MB limit | Compress the document or split into smaller files |
| **Unsupported type** | Not PDF/DOCX/PPTX | Convert to a supported format |
| **Processing failed** | Corrupt or encrypted file | Check file integrity; remove encryption |
| **Extraction poor quality** | Scanned document without OCR | Use a PDF with embedded text, not scanned images |

Files that fail processing can be deleted and re-uploaded after fixing the issue.
