| Strategic planning and competitive landscape | Yes |
| Researching a prospect company | No — use [Client Profile](/docs/agents/special/client-profile) |

## How It Differs from Competitor Analysis

Trinity has two agents that deal with competition:

| Agent | Focus | Input | Best For |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Competitive Intelligence** (this agent) | Standalone deep-dive on a single competitor | Competitor name | Major pursuits, battle planning, strategic analysis |
| **Competitor Analysis** | RFP-context competitor identification and comparison | Project documents | Understanding who's bidding on an RFP |

Use Competitive Intelligence when you know who the competitor is and need detailed intelligence. Use Competitor Analysis when you're working from RFP documents and need to identify and compare likely competitors.
