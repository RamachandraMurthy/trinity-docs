# Requirements Review Agent

The Requirements Review Agent analyzes RFP documents to extract all requirements, classify them by type and priority, and provide strategic recommendations including a bid/no-bid decision.

---

## What It Does

Understand what the RFP is really asking for:

- **Extract all requirements** — Mandatory, desirable, and optional
- **Classify by type** — Technical, business, compliance, legal
- **Identify hidden requirements** — Implicit and "trap" requirements
- **Assess bid viability** — Should you pursue this opportunity?
- **Estimate win probability** — What are your chances?

---

## The Pipeline

This agent uses a 4-step analysis process:

| Step | Agent | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Document Loader | Reviews all RFP documents, identifies structure and sections |
| 2 | Requirements Extraction | Extracts and classifies every requirement |
| 3 | Strategic Analysis | Evaluates complexity, risks, and viability |
| 4 | Executive Report | Compiles findings into actionable report |
