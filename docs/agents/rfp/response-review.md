# Response Review Agent

The Response Review Agent performs a critical "red team" review of your proposal. It evaluates quality across multiple dimensions, identifies weaknesses a competitor or evaluator would find, and provides prioritized improvement recommendations.

---

## What It Does

Get honest feedback before you submit:

- **Evaluate quality** — Score your proposal across 6 dimensions
- **Find weaknesses** — Identify gaps, weak arguments, and risks
- **Anticipate attacks** — What would competitors say about your proposal?
- **Prioritize fixes** — What to fix first for maximum impact

---

## The Pipeline

This agent uses a 4-step analysis process:

| Step | Agent | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Document Understanding | Analyzes structure, claims, and narrative |
| 2 | Quality Evaluation | Scores 6 quality dimensions |
| 3 | Critical Reviewer | Red team analysis — finds weaknesses |
| 4 | Improvement Recommendations | Prioritized fixes with guidance |

---

## Quality Dimensions

Your proposal is scored on six dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **Clarity** | Writing quality, explanation of complex concepts |
| **Completeness** | Whether all requirements are addressed |
| **Persuasiveness** | Strength of arguments, clear "why us" message |
| **Evidence & Proof** | Case studies, metrics, proof points |
| **Client Focus** | Focus on client needs vs. company-centric |
| **Differentiation** | How well the proposal stands out |

Each dimension receives a rating (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor) and a score (1-10).

## When to Use It

| Situation | Use Response Review? |
|---|---|
| Draft proposal ready for review | Yes |
| Final review before submission | Yes |
| Want honest feedback on quality | Yes |
| Just received RFP, haven't started | No — use Requirements Review first |
| Need full gap analysis | Use Requirements-Response Strategy |

---

## Input Requirements

Upload your proposal documents to the project and classify them as "Proposal Response":
- Executive summary
- Technical response
- Management approach
- Past performance
- Pricing narrative (if separate)

For best results, include the RFP as well so the agent understands context.

---

## Tips for Better Results

**Run early, run often** — Don't wait until the last minute. Review drafts as they develop.

**Focus on Priority 1** — Address critical fixes before anything else.

**Compare runs** — Run again after making improvements to track progress.

**Share with the team** — The dimension scores make great discussion points.
